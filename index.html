			    <p>
			        Sensoria Fitness Socks is the top choice for walkers, joggers, or runners. It transmits
                    real-time metrics like speed and distance to a connected smartphone or smartwatch.
                    Furthermore, you can choose your activity and most pertinent trackable metrics
                    according to your fitness goals.
                    Moreover, Sensoria Socks can track your running and walking status like foot landing
                    styles, cadence, calorie burn, and impact score. In addition, the Sensoria Run app
                    provides AI (artificial intelligence) coaching through Mara (your personal trainer). Plus,
                    the virtual coach (Mara) offers real-time audio-video feedback and prevents injuries by
                    recognizing injury-prone running styles.
                    Also, the Virtual Shoe Closet compares your running form and results based on your
                    shoe model, brand, and style against a database of over 8000 options.
                    Consequently, it even alerts you when to get a new pair of shoes. Most notably, it can
                    track your progress and present a graphical representation of sessions, days, weeks, or
                    months.

			        Siren Diabetic Socks &trade;

			    <p>
			        Siren Diabetic Socks, as the name suggests, is specifically designed for diabetic patients. Also,  the fabric incorporates sensors that monitor changes in foot temperature to help reduce the risk of ulcers.
                    Moreover, neuropathy is one of the significant symptoms of diabetes. Hence, an injury can go undetected and cause gangrene, leading to amputation. Thus, wearing Siren Smart Socks, which detects temperature changes, which is a significant sign of inflammation, helps reduce the risk of diabetic ulcers. 
                    However, it is a prescribed product, requiring a consultation with a certified Siren provider. Also, once you plug into the Siren hub, certified nurses review data for symptoms of inflammation to prevent the development of ulcers.
                    On top of that, your physician gets an alert about injuries. As a result, it helps them decide the need for a hospital visit.

			        Athos Smart Garment &trade;

			    </header>
			    <p>
			        Athos Smart Garment is the worldâ€™s first smart clothing brand to analyze major muscle activity. Also, it comes embedded with 14 total sensors consisting of 12 EMG sensors and two heart rate sensors.
                    As a result, these non-adhesive sensors incorporated seamlessly in upper and lower body garments track strain of major muscles like inner and outer quads, hamstrings and glutes of the lower body, and pecs and biceps triceps, deltoids, lats, and traps of the upper body.
                    Moreover, Athos helps athletes and warfighters assess movement and determine injury risk factors through advanced AI (artificial intelligence) mechanisms. Also, you can track muscle activity, heart rate, calorie expenditure, and active time against the rest time using the Athos Smart shirt.
                    Lastly, it uses flexible compression build material that conforms to your body. However, it requires Athos core to collect all the data.
