			    Electronic Textiles or more commonly referred to as E-Textiles are modern fabrics infused with electronic components. Similar to smart fabrics or novel fabrics, these are further explored in the hopes of providing added value to clothing.

E-textiles and functional fabrics are designed with embedded sensors, microcontrollers, batteries, and various other smart electronics. These are used to convert plain clothes or accessories into fully functional but still aesthetically pleasing garments.

With all the tech infusions, these wearables and apparel can detect and respond to external factors or environmental conditions. And with all the added functionalities and uses, these sustainable smart clothes are not just eco-friendly but also lifesavers.

Smart fabrics are taking convenience to a whole new level. These tech innovations are showcasing various uses and benefits.

			    These are smart textiles that also make use of certain electronic components. However, the sensors and circuitry are merely attached and aren’t woven into the fabric. These are bulkier than embedded e-textiles but laminated e-textiles can contain and process more data due to their more complex programming.

With the continued innovations and advancements, the gap between embedded and laminated is expected to narrow down. And eventually, e-textiles would offer more enhanced programming and functionality. Nevertheless, there are now various forms of clothes that adopt these technologies. Here are some of those.

			    Garment innovations aren’t merely affecting the fashion industry but various other industries at the same time. Gamer vests, for instance, have some sort of components that can simulate real-life combat. These make you feel like you’ve physically taken a hit when you get shot in your game, for example. 

Smart fabrics aren’t just shallow or meaningless innovations. In fact, various fashion brands from all over the world have started adopting and embracing these changes.

			    These are smart textiles with electronic components woven into them – these could be environmental sensors or data emitters. These components are thinner than those used in laminated e-textiles, making embedded e-textiles less bulky and more portable. These are also more comfortable for daily use or regular wear.
